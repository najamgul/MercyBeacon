2.4 Vision
A society where communities thrive through education continuity, safer public health conditions, and strong family support, particularly for those most at risk.

3) WHAT WE DO
3.1 Education
Problem
Too many children lose education because of fees, uniforms, transport, or household instability.
What We Do
•	School fee support for deserving students
•	Tuition and learning continuity support
•	College/higher education support for eligible students
•	Back-to-school essentials where needed
How It Helps
We keep students enrolled, reduce dropout risk, and enable families to prioritize education without falling into debt.
3.2 Healthcare & Relief
Problem
Families often delay care because they cannot afford medicines, diagnostics, or basic food support during hardship.
What We Do
•	Support for basic healthcare needs (case-by-case)
•	Food kits and essential household relief during hardship periods
•	Community wellbeing initiatives that reduce health risk
Public references show SHERT participation in food-kit distribution in Srinagar during difficult periods. 
3.3 Women & Family Support
Problem
Vulnerable families, especially girls and women, face social and financial barriers that affect dignity and stability.
What We Do
•	Family assistance for essential needs
•	Support for girls’ education continuity
•	Dignity-centered family support including help for marriages of girls from under-resourced households (ensure policies/safeguards are documented)
How It Helps
We reduce financial pressure, protect dignity, and keep families stable so children remain in school and households remain secure.
3.4 Community Protection
Problem
Communities suffer when public health threats and social harms go unchecked.
What We Do
•	Prevention campaigns and awareness initiatives
•	Community mobilization against harmful practices
•	Public health advocacy (e.g., highlighting risks from food adulteration such as “fake honey/butter/sweets” and related health impacts). 
•	Social harm prevention initiatives (e.g., drug menace awareness—publish only what you can evidence with photos/records)
